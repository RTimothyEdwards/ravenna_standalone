This is a standalone repository for the efabless Ravenna chip,
a small RISC-V microcontroller based on the picoRV32 architecture
and contained in an SoC environment with numerous analog
components such as ADCs, a DAC, temperature sensor, comparator,
etc.;  having 16kB on-board memory, an SPI flash controller,
and 136 bits of non-volatile memory.

The complete set of design files for the Ravenna chip is available
on the efabless platform, but because a number of the files are
X-Fab foundry proprietary, they cannot be used off-platform.

This repository is missing GDS files (proprietary) and most of
the layout, but contains a full set of verilog files for
simulating the Ravenna chip.  The X-Fab proprietary verilog
modules for the analog IP and SRAM blocks have been replaced by
simple functional equivalents.  The Ravenna processor itself is
a RISC-V design, the picoRV32, and the design is open-source.

The chip can be simulated in iverilog by cd'ing to the verilog/
directory and doing "make" or else cd'ing to each of the
subdirectories of verilog/ and running "make" for each
individual testbench.  Each testbench validates a specific
processor or peripheral feature.

Simulation requires the RISC-V riscv32imc gcc toolchain and the
iverilog simulator.  The waveform viewer gtkwave is recommended
for viewing the .vcd output files.

Several simulations have hex targets created from TensorFlow lite.
Ravenna extensions to the TensorFlow repository are in a fork
(to be published mid-2021).

This repository also contains Python scripts which can access
the Ravenna chip on its development board, although these are
just copied from the efabless ravenna repository on github.

Obtaining one of the few existing Ravenna demonstration boards
is another problem altogether.
