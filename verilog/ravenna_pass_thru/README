Note:  In this testbench, unlike the others, the C program is not
driving the simulation.  The C program is just copied from the UART
testbench and gives something to fill the SPI flash with.  The
program is run from the testbench verilog and drives the chip into
"pass_thru" mode to check that it can read data directly off of the
SPI flash through the housekeeping SPI, bypassing the processor.
During pass-thru mode, the processor should be held in reset and
all pins should be inputs or tri-stated except for the flash SPI
pins, which should be copying signals from and to the housekeeping
SPI.
