ravenna_irq2:

This testbench should work exactly like ravenna_irq.  However, some modifications
have been made to support the tensorflow lite micro_speech example, including:

(1) a memory location to hold the address of the start of the ring buffer
(2) a timestamp in (approximately) microseconds
(3) a copy from the buffer low end to an area above the buffer so that
    tensorflow requests for a block of data that wraps around can be passed
    back as a single, non-wrapped block.

(4) The RAM section in sections.lds has been moved forward to 0x800 to
    effectively reserve the area used by the ring buffer and prevent it from
    being used by the compiler.
