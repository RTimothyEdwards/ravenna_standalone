Ravenna --- a full implementation of the PicoRV32 PicoSoC in X-Fab XH018.

This directory contains the top-level module for the ravenna chip, with
all components modeled in (standard or wreal) verilog.  No special flags
to iverilog are required.

Firmware is compiled from the .c files, one for each test.  Comments in
the .c files specify what the tests are and how to interpret results.

To run each testbench, compile the .c file into a hex target "firmware.hex",
then run iverilog / vvp on "ravenna_tb.v".

Documentation is in the doc/ directory of the raven project.

NOTE:  To change memory size, select the appropriate memory IP block
in ravenna.v and modify the include line and the four instantiations
of the memory block.  Change ram_addr width to match.  Change ram_addr
width in source/ravenna_soc.v as well as the definition of MEM_WORDS
in the same file.
