saved_good state:

   1. Set ring buffer between 0x30 and 0x0ffe inclusive
   2. Read from ring buffer current position less one.

This displays the amplitude data on the LEDs and does not
freeze up.

Incorrect behavior:  When it cycles back to the beginning
of the ring buffer loop, the "current position less one"
is outside of the ring buffer, so there's a "strobe"
effect as the ring buffer cycles.
